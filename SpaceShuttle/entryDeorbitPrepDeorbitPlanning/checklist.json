The window should be at least 4 hours in the future as you need time to execute the Deorbit and Entry Perparations.\n\nInsert the Burn MET of choice into the burn tool.\n\nUse the dV X field to plan a descent trajectory that gives you a distance from EI to the Runway between 3900 and 4200, with a Pe of 22 nmi.",
