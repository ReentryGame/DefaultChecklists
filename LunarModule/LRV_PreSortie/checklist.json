The handholds are designed\n\t\tfor ingress by grasping the handhold horizontal and vertical\n\t\tmembers below the payload staffs.\n\r\nc. \tLRV driver ingress LRV left seat and fasten seat belt. \r\nd. \tOther crewman ingress LRV, and fasten seat belt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCAUTION \r\n\t\tDo not grasp the 16 MM Data Acquisition camera staff or low\n\t\tgain antenna staff during ingress. The handholds are designed\n\t\tfor ingress by grasping the handhold horizontal and vertical\n\t\tmembers below the payload staffs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: \r\n\t\tIf this is the first LRV sortie and this procedure sequence\n\t\timmediately follows initial payload loading (2.3) and LRV post\n\t\tdeployment checkout (2.2), then at this point the C/D panel is in\n\t\ta power down configuration in accordance with step 2.2. ad.\n\t\tIf this is the case then step 2.4 need only be a verification\n\t\tas it has been previously accomplished.\n\r\ne. \tBUS A, BUS B, BUS C, BUS D CBs - Close.\r\nf. \tNAV POWER CB - Close.\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCAUTION\r\n\t\tDo not torque nav gyro until nav power has been on for\n\t\t3 minutes.\n\ng. \tReport: BAT 1 and BAT 2 AMPS.\r\nh. \tBATTERY Switch - VOLT x 1/2.\r\ni. \tReport BAT 1 and BAT 2 VOLTS.\r\nj. \tReport BAT 1 and BAT 2 AMP-HR.

If the drive\n\t\tpower switch is turned on and the corresponding drive enable\n\t\tswitch is not selected to an active PWM, then full power will be\n\t\tapplied to the corresponding drive motor when the hand\n\t\tcontroller is released from brake position. Should this condition\n\t\toccur the hand controller should be immediately returned to\n\t\tpark brake position.\r\n\nq. \tDRIVE POWER LF Switch - BUS A. \r\nr. \tDRIVE POWER RF Switch - BUS A.\r\ns. \tDRIVE POWER LR Switch - BUS D. \r\nt. \tDRIVE POWER RR Switch - BUS D.\r\n\nu. \tDrive LRV to level area.
